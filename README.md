# Add comma modifier for Statamic
By Rudy Affandi (2015)
Version 1.0.0

## What is this?
Use this modifier to add comma and a white space to your value's output. You can do this using a series of `if` statement but that would be too long and messy ain't it?

## Changelog
1.0.0 - Initial release

## Installation
Copy the `statamic-addcomma` folder to the `_add-ons` folder in your Statamic website. Rename it to `addcomma`

## How to use

Add `addcomma` to your ouput tag as a modifier.
```
  {{ my_output|addcomma }}
```
